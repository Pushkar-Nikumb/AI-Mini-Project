# AI-Mini-Project
Design and implement an efficient algorithm to find the shortest path between two cities on a map of Maharashtra, India, using the A* search algorithm. The algorithm should generate the heuristic value dynamically for each city pair using the Haversine and Vincenty formulas, taking into account the geographical coordinates of the cities.
